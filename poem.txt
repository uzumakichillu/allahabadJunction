A star is shining somehow,
but the world is sleeping now..
the world that betrayed,the friends he made
all are rising somhow..
but star is shining till now,
in the lone sky ,above up so high
poor star is shining still now
and that world is sleeping damn now..
fun were those days, but life was fray,
but he was surviving somehow.
and the world got jealous now.
world forced his way,
in a path so grey...
his life was getting curse now
of being so pure,with a golden soul
and that gold was getting rust now..
he gave his life,on edge of knife,
the star was setting now
unlike the sun,for his last turn,
the star was shining dim now..
AND THAT DAMN WORLD WAS LAUGHING LOUD
the star was shining somehow.....
hello this was changed by aryan.
